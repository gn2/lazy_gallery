# INSTALL
#
1) Getting simpleviewer (default viewer at the moment)
    - You can download simpleviewer from the following url: http://www.airtightinteractive.com/simpleviewer/
    - Copy to the public/simpleviewer folder the following files from the archive you have downloaded:
          - viewer.swf
          - swfobject.js
2) Installing the gallery
    - Set the public folder as your documentroot for your website. 
    - You need to change the permissions for the cache, albums and public/cache directories: 
       $ chmod 777 albums cache public/cache -Rf
3) Configuring your gallery
    - See next section

#
# CONFIGURATION
#
See conf/config.ini for application configuration. This includes password, RSS configuration and more.
See views/ and public/stylesheets for design configuration. 

#
# USAGE
#
:: Adding albums ::
1. Create directories in public/albums, to create albums.
2. Drop pictures in these directories.
3. You're done !

:: Protecting your pictures ::
Protect your entire gallery by setting galleryProtection to 'true' in the configuration file. Then set galleryPassword to the password of your choice in this same configuration file.

Note 1: Accents in album title (their directory name, actually) can cause some encoding issues at the moment. Picture names support accents however.
Note 2: You may want to visit your new album in order to generate thumbnails.


#
# TO DO
#
- Create passwords for albums.
- Allow sub-albums (the gallery should follow the filesystem structure)
- Store session in a visitor's cookie. (add option in configuration file)
